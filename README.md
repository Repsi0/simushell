# simushell
Simulation of a Linux-like shell for Linux with filesystem access

# Starting the program
Run by typing 'dotnet run' in CLI in SimuShell/SimuShell, Run releases by typing 'dotnet SimuShell.dll' 'mono SimuShell.dll' or 'mono Program.exe' (Warning: Program.exe may not be up to date, and only works with mono by my testing)
Updated builds can be found under ruthenic/SimuShell/SimuShell/Program.exe (mono Program.exe to run, likely out-of-date) and ruthenic/SimuShell/SimuShell/bin/debug/netcoreapp3.1/SimuShell.dll (run with dotnet SimuShell.dll in dir or mono SimuShell.dll)

# Windows?
No.
Due to the difference in directory structures, it would be tough to focus on supporting to operating systems at the same time, so we only support Linux for the time being.
